## The Design Effect

Can be defined: 

$$ DEFF = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2}{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i)^2*n} $$
After weighting for complex sampling, you sum the squared weights and dived it by the sum of the weights squared and multiply by the sample size. 

After calculating the MOE: 

$$MoE = z * \sqrt{ \frac{ p(1-p)}{n} }$$

or using an approximation: 

$$MoE = \frac{.98}{\sqrt{n}}$$

you can update your level of precision of survey findings by incorporating the _DEFF_ & _MoE_ by taking the square root of the _DEFF_ (otherwise known as the _DEFFT_) and multiplying it with the _Mo_

The confidence interval can then be expressed: 

$$\sqrt(DEFF) * MoE$$
