## The Design Effect

Can be defined: 

$$ DEFF = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2}{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i)^2*n} $$

where $w_i$ is the post-stratification weight for any one individual in the survey and _n_ is the sample size of the unweighted sample.  


After weighting for complex sampling, you sum the squared weights and dived it by the sum of the weights squared multiplied by the sample size. 

## Update Confidence Interval to Include Design Effect

After calculating the MOE: 

$$MoE = z * \sqrt{ \frac{ p(1-p)}{n} }$$

or using an approximation: 

$$MoE = \frac{.98}{\sqrt{n}}$$

you update your level of precision of survey findings by incorporating the _DEFF_ & _MoE_ by taking the square root of the _DEFF_ (otherwise known as the _DEFFT_) and multiplying it with the _MoE_

The confidence interval (or margin of error) can then be expressed: 

$$\sqrt(DEFF) * MoE$$
